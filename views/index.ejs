                 Hi! My name is Aidan Waddell and I am a second-year Networking & IT Security student based at Ontario Tech University!</p>
    <p>This webpage will describe who I am, what I do, along with my goals and aspirations both here at Ontario Tech University and outside of the University as well! This website covers everything from my contacts, to what year I am, along with things that I've done with the University! There is a great deal that I've accomplished here and more that I intend to accomplish at the University during the rest of my studies, and I hope to share it with you through this website</p>
